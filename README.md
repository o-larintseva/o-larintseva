👋 Hi, I’m Olga Larintseva @o-larintseva

I’m a skillful QA engineer, based in Tampere, Finland. 

I have 4 years of experience in high-loaded projects, including release leading and decision-making. 
- I am a responsible, communicable person. 
- I have strong negotiation skills within team and management, innate mindfulness multiplied by reasonable perfectionism and a sense of humor.
- I can work confidently with complex documentation, withal I have experience of working ad hoc when the team is lacking in time.
- I'm aspiring automation QA (JS + Cypress, Python + Robot - entry level).

I'm really inspired by Software Testing and QA because my main professional goal is to assess the most possible quality of a product and through it to improve the quality of life and help people. 
My dream is to work among passionate professionals in interesting projects and make these projects as amazing as possible.

👀 I’m interested in life-long education and technologies 
🌱 I’m currently learning Test Automation 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different educational projects
